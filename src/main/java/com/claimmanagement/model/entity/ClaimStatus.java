 * Enumeration representing the various states of a claim in its lifecycle

 * <p>Enums in Java are: - Type-safe constants that prevent invalid values - Implicitly final and
 * extend java.lang.Enum - Can have fields, methods, and constructors - Provide compile-time safety
 * for status values
 *
 * <p>Benefits of using enums for status: 1. Type Safety: Prevents invalid status values 2. Code
 * Readability: Clear, self-documenting status names 3. IDE Support: Auto-completion and refactoring
 * support 4. Performance: Efficient comparison using == operator
